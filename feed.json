It is the first track from their 2000 album, All That You Can’t Leave Behind, and it was released as the album’s lead single. It was a commercial success, helping launch the album to multi-platinum status, and is U2’s biggest hit to date. Like many tracks from All That You Can’t Leave Behind, “Beautiful Day” harkens back to the group’s past sound. The tone of the Edge’s guitar was a subject of debate amongst the band members, as they disagreed on whether he should use a sound similar to that from their early career in the 1980s. Lead singer Bono explained that the upbeat track is about losing everything but still finding joy in what one has. The song received positive reviews, and it became their fourth number one single in the United Kingdom and their first number one in the Netherlands. It also reached the top of the charts in Australia, Canada, Finland, their native Ireland, Italy, Norway and Spain. The song peaked at number 21 in the United States, the band’s highest position since “Discothèque” in 1997. In 2001, the song won three Grammy Awards for Song of the Year, Record of the Year, and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. The group has played “Beautiful Day” at every one of their concerts since the song’s 2001 live debut on the Elevation Tour.","pubDate":"Sat, 02 Sep 2017 12:06:06 GMT","guid":"http://deepcreator.com/2017/09/02/MyView/Music/Beautiful day/","category":"Personal"},{"title":"Bye bye bye","link":"http://deepcreator.com/2017/09/02/MyView/Music/Bye bye bye/","description":"“Bye Bye Bye” is a song by American boy band NSYNC.

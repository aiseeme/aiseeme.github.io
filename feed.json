I tried a couple of different approaches before finding one that works pretty well. This approach uses k-means clustering to cluster the pixels in groups based on their color. The center of those resulting clusters are then the “dominant” colors. k-means is a great fit for this problem because it is (usually) fast. It has the caveat of requiring you to specify up-front how many clusters you want – I found that it works well when I specified around 3.","pubDate":"Sat, 22 Apr 2017 12:29:06 GMT","guid":"http://aisee.me/2017/04/22/Program/Tools/Python/using-python-and-k-means-to-find-the-dominant-colors-in-images/","category":"Program"},{"title":"AiSee","link":"http://aisee.me/2017/04/22/Program/Android/MyApp/aisee/","description":"From zero to OneFrom 1 to 2,3,…Innovation, Smart, Efficient In AI’s eye, there are no apps but positions and intents…Fetch data–&gt;Analyze data–&gt;Create data visit aisee.me , know more…","pubDate":"Sat, 22 Apr 2017 10:18:06 GMT","guid":"http://aisee.me/2017/04/22/Program/Android/MyApp/aisee/","category":"Android"},{"title":"The Domain Names of Blog","link":"http://aisee.me/2017/04/21/MyView/Original/domain-name/","description":"Short, Unforgettable, Meaningful aisee.me ipcreator.me ipcreator.org deepcreator.com smartai.me","pubDate":"Fri, 21 Apr 2017 01:33:18 GMT","guid":"http://aisee.me/2017/04/21/MyView/Original/domain-name/","category":"Personal"},{"title":"What a Beautiful Day","link":"http://aisee.me/2017/04/16/Program/Android/MyApp/what-a-beautiful-day/","description":"Talk is cheap, Show me the Code.Programmers can be great code artists, just like Pianist and wonderful music.","pubDate":"Sun, 16 Apr 2017 13:36:18 GMT","guid":"http://aisee.me/2017/04/16/Program/Android/MyApp/what-a-beautiful-day/","category":"Android"},{"title":"Joke","link":"http://aisee.me/2017/04/13/Program/Android/MyApp/joke/","description":"I love cold jokes, so I developed one yesterday.","pubDate":"Thu, 13 Apr 2017 01:30:18 GMT","guid":"http://aisee.me/2017/04/13/Program/Android/MyApp/joke/","category":"Android"},{"title":"Pyramid Model","link":"http://aisee.me/2017/04/13/MyView/Original/pyramid/","description":"Solid foundation, step by step","pubDate":"Wed, 12 Apr 2017 23:30:18 GMT","guid":"http://aisee.me/2017/04/13/MyView/Original/pyramid/","category":"Personal"},{"title":"Stack Overflow","link":"http://aisee.me/2017/04/13/MyView/Original/stack-overflow/","description":"Time is precious, energy is limited.

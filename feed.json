I tried a couple of different approaches before finding one that works pretty well. This approach uses k-means clustering to cluster the pixels in groups based on their color. The center of those resulting clusters are then the “dominant” colors. k-means is a great fit for this problem because it is (usually) fast. It has the caveat of requiring you to specify up-front how many clusters you want – I found that it works well when I specified around 3.","pubDate":"Sat, 22 Apr 2017 12:29:06 GMT","guid":"http://ipcreator.me/2017/04/22/Program/Tools/Python/using-python-and-k-means-to-find-the-dominant-colors-in-images/","category":"Program"},{"title":"AiSee","link":"http://ipcreator.me/2017/04/22/Program/Android/MyApp/aisee/","description":"From zero to OneFrom 1 to 2,3,…Innovation, Smart, Efficient In AI’s eye, there are no apps but positions and intents…Fetch data–&gt;Analyze data–&gt;Create data visit aisee.me , know more…","pubDate":"Sat, 22 Apr 2017 10:18:06 GMT","guid":"http://ipcreator.me/2017/04/22/Program/Android/MyApp/aisee/","category":"Android"},{"title":"The Domain Names of Blog","link":"http://ipcreator.me/2017/04/21/MyView/Original/domain-name/","description":"Short, Unforgettable, Meaningful aisee.me ipcreator.me ipcreator.org deepcreator.com smartai.me","pubDate":"Fri, 21 Apr 2017 01:33:18 GMT","guid":"http://ipcreator.me/2017/04/21/MyView/Original/domain-name/","category":"Personal"},{"title":"What a Beautiful Day","link":"http://ipcreator.me/2017/04/16/Program/Android/MyApp/what-a-beautiful-day/","description":"Talk is cheap, Show me the Code.Programmers can be great code artists, just like Pianist and wonderful music.","pubDate":"Sun, 16 Apr 2017 13:36:18 GMT","guid":"http://ipcreator.me/2017/04/16/Program/Android/MyApp/what-a-beautiful-day/","category":"Android"},{"title":"Joke","link":"http://ipcreator.me/2017/04/13/Program/Android/MyApp/joke/","description":"I love cold jokes, so I developed one yesterday.","pubDate":"Thu, 13 Apr 2017 01:30:18 GMT","guid":"http://ipcreator.me/2017/04/13/Program/Android/MyApp/joke/","category":"Android"},{"title":"Pyramid Model","link":"http://ipcreator.me/2017/04/13/MyView/Original/pyramid/","description":"Solid foundation, step by step","pubDate":"Wed, 12 Apr 2017 23:30:18 GMT","guid":"http://ipcreator.me/2017/04/13/MyView/Original/pyramid/","category":"Personal"},{"title":"Stack Overflow","link":"http://ipcreator.me/2017/04/13/MyView/Original/stack-overflow/","description":"Time is precious, energy is limited.

Many of these people were in MIT’s Tech Model Railroad Club, where we find the first documented use of “foo” in tech circles in 1959 (and a variant in 1958). Both “foo” and “bar” (and even “baz”) were well known in popular culture, especially from Smokey Stover and Pogo comics, which will have been read by many TMRC members. Also, it seems likely the military FUBAR(F*cked Up Beyond All Repair) contributed to their popularity. 编程里面的foo和bar就是我们小时候写作文里面的小明和小红。写作文的时候，当然情节最重要，花时间去想角色的名字太麻烦了，就干脆叫小明小红好了。","pubDate":"Wed, 12 Apr 2017 12:53:06 GMT","guid":"http://ipcreator.me/2017/04/12/Program/Tools/Computer/foobar/","category":"Personal"},{"title":"Meta Skill——Deliberate Practice","link":"http://ipcreator.me/2017/04/11/Meta Skill/meta-skill-deliberately-practice/","description":"Accumulation is powerful.More Skills, More Weapons, More WaysDeliberate Practice makes perfect Designed to Improve Performance.

<h1 id="Bose-Corporation"><a href="#Bose-Corporation" class="headerlink" title="Bose Corporation"></a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose_Corporation" target="_blank" rel="external">Bose Corporation</a></h1><p>Bose is best known for its home audio systems and speakers,<strong>noise cancelling headphones</strong>, professional audio systems and automobile sound systems. The company has also conducted research into suspension technologies for cars and heavy-duty trucks and into the subject of cold fusion. Bose has a reputation for being particularly protective of its patents, trademarks, and brands.</p>
<h2 id="Our-best-headphones-yet"><a href="#Our-best-headphones-yet" class="headerlink" title="Our best headphones yet"></a>Our best headphones yet</h2><p>You wanted wireless QuietComfort headphones. So we re-engineered them with Bluetooth® technology and our world-class noise cancellation that makes quiet sound quieter and music sound better. So you can just listen. With nothing in the way.</p>
<p><strong>It’s magical to the ears. But it’s not magic.</strong></p>
<p>You feel it at the flip of a switch—noise fades, and your music soars. That’s the power of our Acoustic Noise Cancelling technology, which continuously measures, compares and reacts to outside noise—then cancels them with the opposite signal.</p>
<p><strong>See how it all fits together</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://assets.bose.com/content/dam/Bose_DAM/Web/consumer_electronics/global/products/headphones/qc35_product_page/QC35_product_page_how_it_fits_static_2x1.psd/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1000.1000.png" alt=""></p>
<p>How did we seamlessly merge Bluetooth and noise reduction technology together without compromising our premium audio performance? By obsessing over every detail.</p>
<p><strong>20 Hours Unmatched battery life</strong></p>
<p>They say you can’t get long battery life from wireless headphones. We say, “Try ours.” Enjoy up to 20 hours of listening, enough time to pour through this entire playlist. And when it finally runs down, a quick 15-minute charge gives you another 2.5 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Built better</strong></p>
<p>When you want to take your music anywhere, you need headphones built to keep up. With impact-resistant materials, glass-filled nylon and corrosion-resistant stainless steel, they’re engineered to survive life on the go.</p>
<p>Materials matter. That’s why the QC35 headband isn’t just soft, it’s luxurious. Wrapped in Alcantara®—the soft covering material used by prestigious international companies in various applications, like yachts and high-end automobiles—it provides a welcome comfort designed for all-day listening. The ear cushions are manufactured from a synthetic protein leather, and have a silicone bead for passive noise reduction.</p>

<h2 id="What-is-NFC"><a href="#What-is-NFC" class="headerlink" title="What is NFC?"></a>What is NFC?</h2><p>Near Field Communication (NFC) is a short-range wireless technology that enables two NFC-enabled devices to communicate when they are placed in close proximity, typically less than 4 in (10 cm). For QuietComfort 35 headphones, NFC is used to facilitate Bluetooth pairing. When an NFC-enabled device, such as a smartphone, is placed near the right earcup of the headphones, it pairs them to the device via Bluetooth. Placing the device near the earcup a second time will unpair the headphones.</p>
<h2 id="Can-QuietComfort-35-wireless-headphones-take-calls"><a href="#Can-QuietComfort-35-wireless-headphones-take-calls" class="headerlink" title="Can QuietComfort 35 wireless headphones take calls?"></a>Can QuietComfort 35 wireless headphones take calls?</h2><p>Yes. QuietComfort 35 headphones have a dual-microphone system to allow you to use them during calls when connected to a smartphone that supports the Bluetooth HFP profile. In addition to traditional calls, the headphones will work with many apps that use Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), such as Skype or FaceTime. The dual-mic system helps reject wind and background noise to ensure an exceptional far-end experience, while sidetone lets you hear your own voice so you sound natural when speaking on a call.</p>
<h2 id="How-do-I-pair-QuietComfort-35-wireless-headphones-with-my-mobile-device"><a href="#How-do-I-pair-QuietComfort-35-wireless-headphones-with-my-mobile-device" class="headerlink" title="How do I pair QuietComfort 35 wireless headphones with my mobile device?"></a>How do I pair QuietComfort 35 wireless headphones with my mobile device?</h2><p>For NFC-enabled phones, simply turn on the headphones by sliding the three-position power switch to the middle position. Then tap the back side of your phone on the front of the right earcup where you see the embossed NFC logo, and follow the prompt to accept a connection. If you don’t have an NFC-enabled phone, first, make sure the headphones are turned on by sliding the power switch to the middle position. Next, press the power switch to the Bluetooth icon until the Bluetooth LED flashes blue or the voice-enhanced user interface gives you additional directions. Now, follow the directions within the smartphone’s Bluetooth menu to connect the headphones. The NFC function in iPhone 6/6 Plus or 7/7 Plus only enables Apple pay functionality. It doesn’t facilitate pairing. Please use pairing instructions for phones that are not NFC enabled.</p>
<h2 id="Can-QuietComfort-35-wireless-headphones-simultaneously-be-connected-to-two-mobile-devices"><a href="#Can-QuietComfort-35-wireless-headphones-simultaneously-be-connected-to-two-mobile-devices" class="headerlink" title="Can QuietComfort 35 wireless headphones simultaneously be connected to two mobile devices?"></a>Can QuietComfort 35 wireless headphones simultaneously be connected to two mobile devices?</h2><p>Yes. Multi-point technology allows QC35 headphones to maintain a connection to two devices at the same time—for example, an iPad and a smartphone. So while you’re watching video on the connected iPad, the headphones will automatically pause the video to answer a call from the connected smartphone. When the call is finished, the headphones switch back to the video on the iPad. Please note that audio can be streamed from only one device at a time.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-the-range-of-QuietComfort-35-wireless-headphones"><a href="#What-is-the-range-of-QuietComfort-35-wireless-headphones" class="headerlink" title="What is the range of QuietComfort 35 wireless headphones?"></a>What is the range of QuietComfort 35 wireless headphones?</h2><p>QuietComfort 35 headphones have a range of 33 feet (10 meters) from the source device, typically being the room you’re in and the adjacent room. This range may be reduced by physical obstructions, such as walls and doors, or by interference from other electronic devices. If that happens, move away from wireless routers or microwaves and bring your headphones closer to the Bluetooth device.</p>
<h2 id="How-do-I-charge-QuietComfort-35-wireless-headphones"><a href="#How-do-I-charge-QuietComfort-35-wireless-headphones" class="headerlink" title="How do I charge QuietComfort 35 wireless headphones?"></a>How do I charge QuietComfort 35 wireless headphones?</h2><p>QuietComfort 35 headphones can be charged using the USB cable supplied in the box and plugging it into a USB port on a computer or a wall charger (sold separately). Allow up to 2.25 hours for the headphones to fully charge. Once it is fully charged, the battery indicator light will turn green.</p>
<h2 id="How-long-will-the-battery-stay-charged"><a href="#How-long-will-the-battery-stay-charged" class="headerlink" title="How long will the battery stay charged?"></a>How long will the battery stay charged?</h2><p>QuietComfort 35 headphones use a lithium-ion rechargeable battery that stays powered for up to 20 hours while using the headphones wirelessly and up to 40 hours for wired use.</p>
<h2 id="Can-you-listen-to-music-when-the-battery-runs-down"><a href="#Can-you-listen-to-music-when-the-battery-runs-down" class="headerlink" title="Can you listen to music when the battery runs down?"></a>Can you listen to music when the battery runs down?</h2><p>Yes. These headphones allow users to continue to listen to their source even if the battery power is depleted. However, without power, neither active noise cancellation nor Active EQ is able to function.</p>
<h2 id="Can-I-charge-QuietComfort-35-wireless-headphones-from-my-PC-laptop"><a href="#Can-I-charge-QuietComfort-35-wireless-headphones-from-my-PC-laptop" class="headerlink" title="Can I charge QuietComfort 35 wireless headphones from my PC/laptop?"></a>Can I charge QuietComfort 35 wireless headphones from my PC/laptop?</h2><p>Yes. QuietComfort 35 headphones come with a USB cable that allows the headphones to be charged from your PC or laptop. Please note that the PC or laptop must be on and awake in order to charge over USB.</p>
<h2 id="What-are-the-buttons-for-on-the-back-of-the-right-earcup"><a href="#What-are-the-buttons-for-on-the-back-of-the-right-earcup" class="headerlink" title="What are the buttons for on the back of the right earcup?"></a>What are the buttons for on the back of the right earcup?</h2><p>The larger middle button is the multi-function button. It initiates play/pause and other track controls for videos and music, answers and ends calls, and can also initiate voice commands such as Siri or voice dial. The buttons on either side of the multi-function button are volume +/- buttons. They allow you to easily adjust volume in an intuitive up/down vertical orientation.</p>
